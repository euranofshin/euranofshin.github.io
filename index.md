# About
I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in computer science at Harvard University, co-advised by [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) (at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/)) and [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). 
I'm excited about how we might use models of human decision-making to improve how artificial agents assist as. 
Reinforcement learning, user studies, and behavior modeling are part of my daily toolkit. 
I am grateful for the support of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

A large part of my work involves [digital interventions](https://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2024/pdfs/p2761.pdf), where we use reinforcement learning to personalize behavioral interventions. For example, planning when to send "reminders to move" on a fitness app. Here, I ask how models from behavior science can provide the inductive bias our algorithm needs to quickly learn the best intervention for each person. 
Another part of my work involves [explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00116), where we investigate how different downstream tasks require different properties of explanations.
Here, I ask how human models can be used to simulate user studies, which help us narrow in on the most promising property-task relationships prior to verification with real humans. 


During my CS undergrad at the University of Kentucky, I had the pleasure of working with [Simone Silvestri](http://silvestri.engr.uky.edu/) on algorithms for smart home applications. I also participated in some wonderful REU programs at [DePaul University](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix/index.htm) (mentored by Daniela Raicu) and [USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/reu/) (mentored by Stefanos Nikolaidis).

# Teaching and Mentorship
I am a teaching fellow and course developer for [CS290A & CS290B](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/): Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023). We are currently working on making the teaching materials [available online](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-teaching-materials/). 
In Spring 2022, I served as a teaching fellow for [STAT234](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/teaching/stat234spring2022/syllabus.htm): Sequential Decision Making. 

I serve as a direct research mentor for a number of undergraduate and master's students in the intersection of reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction.

I've developed the material for a number of guest lectures on Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Research Skills: 
* How to conduct a literature search. CS290 Fall 2022. Detailed course plan [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-teaching-materials/posts/how-to-conduct-a-literature-search/) and guide [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-do-a-literature-search/).
* Hieararchical Reinforcement Learning. STAT234 Spring 2022. Slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X4tczMs_Nochk22at_QDpaweq06mLKmK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118113328700788555497&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

# Outreach
**Leadership**
I was one of the founding member of the [University of Kentucky ACM-W](http://acm-w.cs.uky.edu/index.html) chapter. During this time, I created a series of introductory CS workshops for high-school students from counties in Kentucky without a computer science class/program. 

**Talks and workshops**
* I was a mentor for the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Cambridge datathon workshop in Spring 2020.
* I gave a joint talk titled "[What is Machine Learning?](https://www.harvardwecode.com/conference-schedule/women-in-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence)" at Harvard's WECode 2023.
