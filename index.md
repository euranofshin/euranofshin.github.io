# About
I'm a fourth year PhD candidate in computer science at Harvard University, co-advised by [Finale Doshi-Velez](https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/) (at the [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/)) and [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). 
I'm excited about modeling user behavior on mobile health apps, with the goal of providing users with personalized interventions. Lately I've been thinking about how to model people's daily decision making processes, surrounding health and behavior change, with reinforcement learning. I am grateful for the support of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

During my CS undergrad at the University of Kentucky, I had the pleasure of working with [Simone Silvestri](http://silvestri.engr.uky.edu/) on algorithms for smart home applications. I also participated in some wonderful REU programs at [DePaul University](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/research/vc/medix/index.htm) (mentored by Daniela Raicu) and [USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/reu/) (mentored by Stefanos Nikolaidis).

# Teaching and Mentorship
I am a teaching fellow and course developer for [CS290A & CS290B](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/): Effective Research Practices & Academic Culture (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023). We are currently working on making the teaching materials [available online](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-teaching-materials/). 
In Spring 2022, I served as a teaching fellow for [STAT234](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/teaching/stat234spring2022/syllabus.htm): Sequential Decision Making. 

I serve as a direct research mentor for a number of undergraduate and master's students in the intersection of reinforcement learning and human-computer interaction.

I've developed the material for a number of guest lectures on Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Research Skills: 
* How to conduct a literature search. CS290 Fall 2022. Detailed course plan [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290-teaching-materials/posts/how-to-conduct-a-literature-search/) and guide [here](https://yanivyacoby.github.io/harvard-cs290/materials/how-to-do-a-literature-search/).
* Hieararchical Reinforcement Learning. STAT234 Spring 2022. Slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X4tczMs_Nochk22at_QDpaweq06mLKmK/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118113328700788555497&rtpof=true&sd=true). 

# Outreach
**Leadership**
I was one of the founding member of the [University of Kentucky ACM-W](http://acm-w.cs.uky.edu/index.html) chapter. During this time, I created a series of introductory CS workshops for high-school students from counties in Kentucky without a computer science class/program. 

**Talks and workshops**
* I was a mentor for the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Cambridge datathon workshop in Spring 2020.
* I gave a joint talk titled "[What is Machine Learning?](https://www.harvardwecode.com/conference-schedule/women-in-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence)" at Harvard's WECode 2023.
